# cologne-trees-data
Create dataset of trees in Cologne, Germany.

## About
There are (as of now) 2 official datasets (from 2017 and 2020) about the city tree situation in Cologne (Germany), published by the city. Unfortunately, these datasets are far from satisfying in different data scientific regards.    
Hence, this process chain in order to address these issues by cleaning up and enriching the data.    

## Usage
Processed datasets can be found in /data/exports    
- trees_cologne.jsonln.tar.gz
- trees_cologne_reduced.jsonln.tar.gz

Both sets are stored as JSON line. For information about created data and how the original data is processed, enriched and stored, please refer to:    
[dataschema.md](https://github.com/zushicat/cologne-trees-data/blob/master/dataschema.md)



**If you like to process the data on your own**, please place following official "Baumkataster" csv datasets
